# Introduction to Python

In this session we'll look at a few basic Python concepts, and explore how to manipulate and analyse data using Pandas. Below are a few links that you may find useful:

## Getting started

The following was the learning path that I used when I was starting out:

* First, get a version of Python. If you're on a Mac, you can start a Python shell in a terminal just by typing `iPython`. You should also download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/), a distribution designed for data science.
* To get started with coding, have a look at the official [Python Tutorial](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/index.html). You don't have to go through it all, but the first sections give a good overview of the language
* The [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) will get you started in the most important libraries: numpy, pandas and matplotlib. If you are interested in machine learning, there's also a section on scikit-learn 

## Text editors / IDEs
* [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
* [Atom](https://atom.io/)
* [Jupyter notebooks](https://jupyter.org/)
    * [Keyboard shortcuts](http://maxmelnick.com/2016/04/19/python-beginner-tips-and-tricks.html)

## Python libraries

* [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/)
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
* [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/)

For data visualisation, you should also look at:
* [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)
* [Plotly](https://plot.ly/python/)
* [Chartify](https://github.com/spotify/chartify) (by Spotify)
* [Dash](https://plot.ly/products/dash/) (Dashboarding web framework, by plotly)

## Other

* [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)
    * [Markdown cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet)
* Style guide: [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)
